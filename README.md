WorkByte: A web app for rating, reviewing, and sharing rentable work space. This project is a hobby to keep my full stack development skills sharp.
Backend: https://github.com/NPraglin/backend

## Technologies Used
- MERN Stack

## Road Map
- ~~Migration to AWS file hosting~~
- ~~Finish all places/search function with custom component rendering all places as smaller boxes~~
- ~~Migration to FireBase SPA (front end) hosting~~
- Add rating stars (selectable) to place items
- Click to enlarge on place items
- Show pricing info on possible rented places
- Dropdown menu for "my profile" when logged in to show "my places" and "add place" on the navbar
- Search locations based on free food/beverage
- Search by zip code, city, and state implemented
- API connection to view available space in area
- Add website links for posted locations

## Current Bugs
- Adding a place doesn't work as of 8 April 2022 due to AWS usage limitations. Upgrading data limitations shortly
