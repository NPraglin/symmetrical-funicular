WorkByte: A web app for rating, reviewing, and sharing rentable work space. This project is a hobby to keep my full stack development skills sharp.
Backend: https://github.com/NPraglin/backend

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- Google Maps API / Google Address => Coordinates API
- Mantine React Library: https://mantine.dev/ 
- Tabler Icons Library: https://tabler-icons.io/ 
- Firebase (Frontend)
- Heroku (Backend)
- AWS S3 (Images/Data)

## Road Map
- ~~Migration to AWS file hosting~~
- ~~Finish all places/search function with custom component rendering all places as smaller boxes~~
- ~~Migration to FireBase SPA (front end) hosting~~
- Add rating stars (selectable) to place items
- Click to enlarge on place items
- Show pricing info on possible rented places
- Dropdown menu for "my profile" when logged in to show "my places" and "add place" on the navbar
- Search locations based on free food/beverage
- Search by zip code, city, and state implemented
- API connection to view available space in area
- Add website links for posted locations

## Current Bugs
- Visiting the profile of a user with 0 places returns a looping error. Working on fix. It can be excaped by clicking the home "WorkByte" button on the NavBar a few times quickly.
